            <h2>There are over 52 million children in India with developmental disabilities and over 650,000 in Mumbai alone. Out of these, not even a quarter have access to quality care.</h2>
            <p>Spreading Hope offers personalized services for differently abled children. Equipped with a dedicated clinic, the centre caters to the needs of a child at all stages of his/her development and provides quality care through early identification, intervention, school age and specialized services. Our treatment strategy focuses on quality, stability, innovation, and positive outcome for both the guardians and their children and is curated after a detailed analysis by way of "scores." Under this treatment method, our team analyzes the inputs provided by Developmental Paediatrics, Child Psychiatry, Child Psychology, Speech and Language, Hearing, Occupational therapy, Physiotherapy departments and Special instructors and Play therapists on the way the child is playing with toys, interacts with his or her friends and their behavioural patterns - eating and sleeping habits. Based on this analysis, we provide a customized treatment plan that is community-oriented, inclusive, and responsive to the overall development of the child.<br>Our services are delivered in a culture of excellence, and diversity and address common conditions like Attention deficit disorder, Attention Deficit Hyperactive Disorder, Obsessive Compulsive Disorder and Autism Spectrum Disorder.</p>
